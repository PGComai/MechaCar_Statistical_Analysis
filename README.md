## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![image](/images/linear_reg_mpg.png)

After performing multiple linear regression on the MechaCar vehicle metrics with respect to MPG (miles per gallon), two variables display high variance (ground_clearance and vehicle_length), and one displays slight variance (vehicle_weight). The summary of the regression model can be viewed in the above image.

The slope of the model should be non-zero, since some of the variables are the cause of significant variance in MPG. To the extent that the r-squared value reflects a good fit, it seems like the model predicts MechaCar MPG effectively.
